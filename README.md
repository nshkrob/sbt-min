# Minimal SBT example

This is an example SBT project. The goal is to setup a small runnable Scala project quickly.

Code goes into root directory (This does not follow the 'Standard Directory Layout'!)

Tests go into test directory.

Dependencies are in project.sbt.

To run:

    ./sbt run
    ./sbt test

Or

    ./sbt
    > test

Repl:

    ./sbt console
